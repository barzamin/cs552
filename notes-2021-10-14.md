# Microprogramming

- instead of writing down FSMs for control
- why not write an actual language!

- decoding instruction points into in microprogram memory
- outputs of microcode storage are datapath control lines
## benefits:
- more disciplined control logic
- more complex isas enabled
- late fixes
## however:
1980s: CAD tools and PLAs offer similar structuring ability
- caches make memory ~as fast as control store

## but today:
- FSM doesn't scale easily
- microprograms work
- HDL is optimal

- majority of designs use a PLA with HDL design, could be RAM or ROM

## microcode: horizontal v vertical
fewer wide instructions vs more narrow instructions

# intro to superscalar
- many processors have two-phase clock ($\phi_1$, $\phi_2$)

- motivation: stalling on memory/cache kills the pipeline
- ILP: but there's limits?

- IPC: instructions per cycle

superpiplining: major-minor cycles
cycle time = 1/m of baseline
