# pipelining
- single cycle: good CPI, bad cycle time (max of all instructions)
- want to make runtime shorter for shorter instructions
=> multicycle implementations

pipelining: if we have multicycle implementations, we can overlap instruction execution!
- ideally: CPI = 1
	- but assumes uniform subcomputations
	- and identical instruction stream
	- and independent computations (no pipeline hazards!)
- in reality, we can get close enough to get significant speedup

- what stages responsible for setting control signals?
	- ex: RegWrite
		- mem/wb stage *loops back in pipeline*

- control becomes distributed FSM (hard to verify)
