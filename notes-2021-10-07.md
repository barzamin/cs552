# Pipeline Hazards
- program dependencies
- data hazards
	- stalls & forwarding
- control hazards
- exceptions

## data dependencies
### true dependence (RAW)
example:
```
r2 <- r5 + r3
r4 <- r2 + r3
```

### anti-dependence (WAR)
```
r2 <- r5 + r3
r3 <- r1 + r8
```

### output dependence (WAW)
another example:
```
r4 <- r5 + r1
r4 <- r2 + r3
```

## control dependencies
- conditional branches: must execute to determine where to jump
	- following instructions control-dependent on branch

## Pipeline hazards
- occur when a potential violation of dependencies exists
- must ensure no violation occurs

- conditions:
	- WAR/RAW/WAW

## example pipeline data hazards
IF -> ID -> RD -> ALU -> MEM -> WB

- MEM only can transact once per instruction
	- WAR: no
	- WAW: no
	- RAW: no

- register hazards:
	- WAR: no, because writes are sequential
	- WAW: no, ibid
	- RAW: yes! reads, writes can be interleaved

ex:
```
add $1, $2, $3
sub $4, $5, $1
```
- solutions:
	1. stall dependent instruction
	2. forward dependent result directly to next instruction

## control dependence 
- if we, eg, `bne` on a result, we can't feed next instruction into pipeline (bc we need to fetch after updating PC!)
- stall next instruction fetch until PC known

## pipelined control
- needs to be embedded in pipeline
	- not explicit FSM; distributed across stages

## stalling (data)
- detect data reusage
- IF, ID hold
- send nop down pipeline
- PCWrite, IF/IDWrite, nop muxes

## forwarding
- comparators: ensure register is read after written
- instead of stalling, use mux to select forwarded value as input to execution
	- mux controlled via hazard detection logic
- can have deeper forwarding paths for dependencies farther down instruction stream
