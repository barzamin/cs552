# Single-cycle control paths

- datapath:
	- Imem, Dmem
	- ALU
	- reg file
	- PC
	- regs, D, PC writeback at end of cycle

- we need control
	- inputs: {instruction, zero}
	- outputs: {mux control, ALUop, WEs}

- MIPS: why do we have 6-bit opcode, 6-bit function code
	- 2^12 possible instructions!! why???
	- => control is *faster* and *simpler* if we don't have super dense opcodes

- need to use ALU for basically all instructions (address computation!)
- muxes to select fields based on opcode
- global control:
	- ALU control, src (pick btwn reg, sext(imm))
- PLAs for control logic
	- AND plane producing prod terms
	- OR plane producing outputs from prod terms
- recent AMD microcode bug
	- BIOS process and boot security
	- checks for working hw RNG
	- AMD: RNG that only generates all-1 outputs
	- so wouldn't boot!

- single-cycle issues
	- critical path probably lw
		- slow dmem accessses!
	- other instructions much faster (ex rrr)
	- but the cycle must be as slow as the slowest instruction
	- for full ISA: time variation even worse
		- FP divide
		- cache misses

- solutions?
	- variable clock WAY too hard to use
	- short cycles but have multiple-cycle instructions (what (almost) everyone does)
