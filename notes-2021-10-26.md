- SRAM: expensive, small, fast (~10ns)
- DRAM: cheap, large (>1TB!), slower (~100ns)
- memory hierarchy
- "more important than processor"
- low latency, high bw, lots of storage! and we want cheap /bit. how to reconcile?

cache example:

processor -10ns-> cache -100ns-> memory

request stream: A, A, A, A, B, B, B, C, C, D
1. how long w/o cache?
	xxx


cache can only be perfect if we preload exactly what we need in advance
